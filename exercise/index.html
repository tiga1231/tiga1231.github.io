    <h3>Subtraction Rule (Principle of inclusion-exclusion)</h3>
  </header>
  <p>If a task can be done in either $n_1$ ways or $n_2$ ways, then the number of ways to do the task is $n_1 + n_2$ ways <em>minus</em> the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways. This rule is also known as the principle of inclusion-exclusion.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

  <p>What is the number of elements in $S \cup T$ ?</p>
  <p>$S=\dots$</p>

  <header><h3>Example</h3></header>
  <p>Show that among any $n+1$ positive integers not exceeding $2n$ there must be an integer that divides one of the other integers.</p>
  <p>(hint: Represent any $n+1$ positive integers in the form $2^kq$. 
  There are only $n$ odd numbers among $1 \sim 2n$... )</p>
</article>


<article>
  <header><h3>Example</h3></header>
  <p><b>Definitions</b><br>
  Suppose that $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ is a sequence of real numbers. </p>
  <p>
  A <em>subsequence</em> of this sequence is a sequence of the form $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_m}$ 
  where $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 \dots < i_m \leq N$; <br>
  i.e. it is formed by including some terms from the original sequence while maintaining their relative order. </p>
  <p>
  A sequence is <em>strictly increasing</em> if each term is larger than the one preceding it, while it is <em>strictly decreasing</em> if each term is smaller than the one that precedes it.</p>
</article>

<article>
<p><b>Theorem</b> Every sequence of $n^2 + 1$ distinct real numbers contains a subsequence of length $n+1$ that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>
The sequence $$8, 11, 9, 1, 4, 6, 12, 10, 5, 7$$
has $10( = 3^2+1)$ terms.The theorem tells us there is an increasing/decresing subsequence of length $4(=3+1)$
$$1, 4, 6, 7$$
